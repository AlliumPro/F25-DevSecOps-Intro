## 🛠 Lab-Based Learning Experience

**80% of your grade comes from hands-on labs** — each one builds practical security skills:

1. **Lab Structure**

   * Realistic, task-oriented challenges with clear goals
   * Safe environments using containers, local VMs, or cloud credits

2. **Submission Workflow**

   * Fork course repository → Create lab branch → Complete tasks
   * Push to fork → Open Pull Request → Receive feedback & evaluation

3. **Grading Advantage**

   * **Perfect Labs (10/10)**: Exam exemption + bonus points toward A
   * **On-Time (≥6/10)**: Guaranteed pass (C or higher)
   * **Late**: Maximum 6/10

---

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

*Transparent assessment for skill validation*

### Grade Composition

* Labs (10 × 8 points each): **80%**
* Final Exam (comprehensive): **20%**

### Performance Tiers

* **A (90-100)**: Mastery with innovative solutions
* **B (75-89)**: Consistent completion, minor improvement needed
* **C (60-74)**: Basic competency, some gaps
* **D (0-59)**: Fundamental gaps, re-attempt required

---

## ✅ Success Path

> *"Complete all labs with ≥6/10 to pass. Perfect lab submissions grant exam exemption and bonus points toward an A."*
